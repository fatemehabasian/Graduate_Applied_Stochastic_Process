## Introduction

In the digital advertising industry, firms face the challenge of effectively allocating their advertising budgets across multiple platforms to maximize engagement and revenue. This problem can be modeled as a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, where each platform acts as an "arm" of a slot machine, and the firm must balance exploration (testing different platforms) with exploitation (investing more in platforms that perform well). This project explores the application of three different MAB algorithms—Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Thompson Sampling (TS), and a novel Adaptive Exploration-Exploitation (AEE) strategy—in simulating and optimizing ad allocation strategies for a multi-platform firm.

## Methodology

### Problem Formulation

The problem involves \(K\) firms advertising across \(L\) different platforms. The effectiveness of an ad for firm \(i\) on platform \(j\) is represented by a click probability \(p_{ij}\), which depends on the interaction between the firm’s features (\(c_i\)) and the platform’s features (\(s_j\)). These features are represented as vectors in a \(d\)-dimensional space.

### Algorithms Implemented

#### Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Algorithm

The UCB algorithm selects the platform that maximizes the upper confidence bound of the estimated click probability. This approach prioritizes platforms with higher uncertainty, balancing exploration and exploitation by adjusting the focus as more data becomes available.

#### Thompson Sampling (TS)

Thompson Sampling selects platforms based on sampling from the posterior distribution of the click probabilities. It naturally balances exploration and exploitation by considering the uncertainty in the probability estimates, often outperforming UCB in practical scenarios.

#### Adaptive Exploration-Exploitation (AEE) Strategy

The AEE strategy dynamically adjusts the balance between exploration and exploitation based on real-time performance feedback. Unlike UCB, which uses a fixed exploration term, and TS, which relies on probabilistic sampling, AEE modifies its behavior according to the observed outcomes, making it potentially more flexible and responsive.

### Simulation Process

The simulation process involved running each algorithm over a specified horizon, where firms repeatedly decide which platforms to allocate their ads to, based on the strategies outlined. Key metrics such as estimated click probabilities, cumulative revenue, and revenue per ad were collected to evaluate and compare the algorithms' performance under various conditions.

## Results

### Performance of UCB

The UCB algorithm showed a steady increase in cumulative revenue, but it lagged behind Thompson Sampling and AEE in scenarios with a larger number of platforms. The results highlighted UCB's conservative exploration approach, which, while theoretically robust, may miss high-revenue opportunities early on.

### Performance of Thompson Sampling

Thompson Sampling generally outperformed UCB, particularly in the initial phases, by quickly identifying high-revenue platforms. However, in complex scenarios with a high number of platforms, TS struggled with the increased exploration burden, leading to a plateau in performance.

### Performance of Adaptive Exploration-Exploitation (AEE) Strategy

The AEE strategy consistently outperformed both UCB and Thompson Sampling, especially in complex environments with a large number of platforms. AEE's dynamic adjustment allowed for rapid revenue growth and accurate click probability estimates, making it the most effective strategy across various scenarios.

## Comparison Between UCB, Thompson Sampling, and AEE

The comparison revealed that while UCB provides robust performance in simpler scenarios, Thompson Sampling generally offers better revenue growth in more complex environments. AEE, with its adaptive strategy, outperformed both, particularly in scenarios with high-dimensional feature spaces and a large number of firms and platforms.

## Areas for Improvement

### Dynamic Threshold Adjustment

Further research is needed to refine the thresholds used in AEE for adjusting exploration and exploitation. Machine learning models could be explored to predict optimal switching points, enhancing AEE's adaptability.

### Scalability to Larger Systems

As the number of firms and platforms increases, the computational complexity of AEE also grows. Future work should focus on developing more efficient algorithms to handle larger-scale systems, potentially through parallel processing or approximation methods.

### Incorporating Contextual Information

Incorporating additional contextual information, such as time of day, user demographics, or historical performance, could improve the accuracy of probability estimates and the effectiveness of exploration-exploitation decisions.

### Real-World Testing and Validation

While simulation results are promising, real-world testing is crucial to validate AEE's effectiveness. Deploying AEE in actual advertising scenarios would provide valuable insights into its practical performance and areas for further refinement.
